# Hello World tutorial

Welcome to the **Hello World tutorial**—your first step toward developing with iR Engine. This guide is designed to give you a **hands-on introduction** to the engine’s core concepts through a structured, practical approach.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have set up a working project, created an entity, assign components, and explore the **Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern**, which is fundamental to how iR Engine operates.

## What you will learn

This tutorial covers the following core concepts:

✅ **Project setup:** Installing and running iR Engine.

✅ **Creating an entity:** Understanding how entities function in ECS.

✅ **Attaching components:** Making an entity **visible**, **interactive**, and **movable**.

✅ **Using the ECS pattern:** Structuring logic with **systems and queries**.

✅ **Configuring the engine:** Registering and managing your project in iR Engine.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a **basic functional project** and an introductory foundation for working with the engine.
