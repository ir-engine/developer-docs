# Hello World tutorial

Welcome to the **Hello World tutorial**, your first step in developing with iR Engine. This guide provides a structured, hands-on introduction to the engine’s core concepts, helping you set up a project and understand its fundamental architecture.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- Installed and configured a working **TypeScript project** in iR Engine.
- Created an **entity** and attached components.
- Explored the **Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern**, the foundation of iR Engine’s architecture.
- Defined **systems** to manage entity behavior.
- Used **queries** to dynamically access and modify entities.

This tutorial is designed for developers who are new to iR Engine and want a structured introduction.

## What you will learn

This tutorial covers the following core concepts:

- ✅ **Project setup:** Installing iR Engine and configuring the <a href="https://github.com/ir-engine/ir-tutorial-hello" target="_blank">tutorial project</a>.
- ✅ **Entities and components**: Creating and modifying entities in a scene.
- ✅ **The ECS pattern: **Understanding how iR Engine structures logic and data.
- ✅ **Systems and queries: **Writing and optimizing logic.
- ✅ **Best practices**: Applying clean, modular, and scalable design principles.&#x20;

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a **basic functional project** and an introductory foundation for working with the engine.
