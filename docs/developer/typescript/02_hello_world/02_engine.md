# Start working with the engine

Now that you understand **how ECS structures entities and components**, itâ€™s time to **modify your projectâ€™s source code** and start interacting with iR Engine.

:::hint{type="info"}
**This guide will teach you how to:**

- âœ… Modify a projectâ€™s source code to change its behavior.
- âœ… Import necessary components and utilities.
- âœ… Configure a project to run inside iR Engine.
- âœ… Use best practices for working with ECS.
:::

## Requirements and dependencies

To start working on an iR Engine project, you typically follow these **three steps**:

1. **Install iR Engine** (already completed).
2. **Install or create a project** (already completed).
3. **Modify and run the projectâ€™s source code** (this guide).

:::hint{type="info"}
ðŸ’¡ **Installation instructions**
For full installation details, see the [Installation](./../../../manual/01_install/index.md) guide in the **Technical Manual**.
:::

### Required tools

Throughout this guide, we will use **git** and **npm**. If you followed the [Quickstart guide](./../01_quickstart/index.md), these tools should already be installed.

## Installing and running projects

iR Engine supports **projects**, which function similarly to projects in other game engines but are **modular like npm packages**. Understand that **projects are the way you extend the engine's functionalities**.

Each projectâ€™s **source code runs globally**, which will become an important concept later.

### **Projects directory structure**

By default, iR Engine scans for projects inside:

```shell
/packages/projects/projects/
```

To install and run a new project, use:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/ir-engine/ir-tutorial-hello packages/projects/projects/ir-tutorial-hello
npm run dev
```

ðŸ’¡ **Restart required**
After installing a new project, **restart the engine** to apply changes.

## Configuring projects

To integrate a projectâ€™s source code with iR Engine, you must:

1. **Import iR Engine modules**.
2. **Export the code so the engine can execute it**.

### **Project configuration file**

Each project has an `xrengine.config.ts` file, which registers it with the engine:

```typescript
import type { ProjectConfigInterface } from '@ir-engine/packages/projects/ProjectConfigInterface'

const config: ProjectConfigInterface = {
  onEvent: undefined,
  thumbnail: '/static/ir-engine_thumbnail.jpg',
  routes: {},
  services: undefined,
  databaseSeed: undefined,
  // highlight-start
  worldInjection: () => import('./src/Hello')  // Connect Hello.ts to the engine
  // highlight-end
}

export default config
```

For now, just remember: **this file tells iR Engine how to load your project**.

## Importing required modules

In this tutorial, we will modify a **sphere primitive** in the scene.

### **Importing spatial components**

Since the sphere is a **spatial** object, we must import components from the **spatial engine module**:

```typescript
import { NameComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/spatial/src/common/NameComponent'
import { VisibleComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/spatial/src/renderer/components/VisibleComponent'
import { TransformComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/spatial/src/transform/components/TransformComponent'
import { PrimitiveGeometryComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/engine/src/scene/components/PrimitiveGeometryComponent'
import { Vector3 } from 'three'
```

### **Importing ECS utilities**

To manage entities, we also import **ECS functions**:

```typescript
import { ECS } from '@ir-engine/packages/ecs'
```

## Modifying the source code

Now that we understand the project structure, let's modify the **sphereâ€™s geometry**.

### **Updating the geometry type**

Instead of hardcoding the value `1` for a sphere, we will use a readable **enum**.

### **Steps**

1. Open `ir-tutorial-hello/src/Hello.ts`.
2. Import `GeometryTypeEnum` from the `scene/constants/` module.
3. Replace `1` with `GeometryTypeEnum.SphereGeometry`.

### **Where is the enum?**

If youâ€™re unsure where the enum is located, use these hints:

```typescript
// Full path to GeometryTypeEnum:
import { GeometryTypeEnum } from '@ir-engine/packages/engine/src/scene/constants/GeometryTypeEnum'

// Assign a sphere:
GeometryTypeEnum.SphereGeometry

// Assign a cylinder instead (for testing):
GeometryTypeEnum.CylinderGeometry
```

:::hint{type="info"}
ðŸ’¡ **No need to restart**
After modifying **source code**, simply **refresh the browser**â€”no need to restart the engine.
:::

## Final implementation

After applying the changes, your **Hello.ts** file should look like this:

:::codeblocktabs
src/Hello.ts

```typescript
import { ECS } from '@ir-engine/packages/ecs'
import { NameComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/spatial/src/common/NameComponent'
import { VisibleComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/spatial/src/renderer/components/VisibleComponent'
import { TransformComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/spatial/src/transform/components/TransformComponent'
import { PrimitiveGeometryComponent } from '@ir-engine/packages/engine/src/scene/components/PrimitiveGeometryComponent'
import { Vector3 } from 'three'
// highlight-start
import { GeometryTypeEnum } from '@ir-engine/packages/engine/src/scene/constants/GeometryTypeEnum'
// highlight-end

const entity = ECS.createEntity()
ECS.setComponent(entity, NameComponent, 'hello-world')
ECS.setComponent(entity, VisibleComponent)
ECS.setComponent(entity, TransformComponent, { position: new Vector3(0, 1, 0) })
// highlight-start
ECS.setComponent(entity, PrimitiveGeometryComponent, { geometryType: GeometryTypeEnum.SphereGeometry })
// highlight-end
```
:::

## Confirming the changes

To verify that your changes were applied:

1. Open [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio).
2. Open the **ir-tutorial-hello** project.
3. Create a new scene.
4. âœ… A **white sphere** should appear in the center.

ðŸŽ‰ **Great job!**
You have successfully modified and run your first iR Engine project.
Now, let's learn how to [add logic with Systems](./03_system.md).
