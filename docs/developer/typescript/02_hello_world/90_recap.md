# Recap and next steps

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You have completed the **Hello World** tutorial for iR Engine using TypeScript.

This introductory guide covered the **fundamental concepts** of iR Engine development, giving you a solid foundation to build upon.

---

## What you accomplished

Throughout this tutorial, you explored how to create a **minimal working example** in iR Engine. Hereâ€™s a summary of what you learned:

### Project setup and structure

âœ… Installed and configured a **TypeScript project** in iR Engine.  
âœ… Integrated the project with the engine using `xrengine.config.ts`.  

### Entities and components

âœ… Created an **entity** with a unique identifier.  
âœ… Attached core **components** to define behavior.

### Working with systems

âœ… Defined a **system** to manage logic execution.  
âœ… Used a **custom component** to store state.  
âœ… Queried entities dynamically based on their **assigned components**.  
âœ… Controlled execution flow by **managing state within components**.  

### Best practices

âœ… Used **ECS principles** to separate logic from data.  
âœ… Ensured **systems execute only when needed** by querying entities with specific components.  
âœ… Structured the code to follow **modular and scalable design patterns**.  

With these skills, you can now confidently create **interactive scenes and dynamic systems** in iR Engine.

## Whatâ€™s next?

Now that youâ€™ve learned the essentials, itâ€™s time to expand your knowledge with the [Engine basics tutorial](./../03_basics_tutorial/index.md), where you will learn:

- **Writing clean and maintainable code**: Learn best practices for structuring your project efficiently.
- **Building custom components**: Extend the engineâ€™s functionality by defining your own component data.
- **Defining queries**: Retrieve and manipulate entities dynamically based on their components.
- **Working with physics**: Add rigidbodies, collisions, and physics interactions to your entities.
- **State management**: Optimize how entities store and update data within systems.
- **Managing environments and scenes**: Control scene publishing and world loading.
