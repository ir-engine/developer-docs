# Recap and next steps

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You have completed the **Hello World** tutorial for iR Engine using TypeScript.

This tutorial introduced you to the **fundamentals of iR Engine development**, providing a solid foundation for working with the engine.

---

## What you accomplished

Throughout this tutorial, you built a **functional project** while learning key ECS concepts. Hereâ€™s a recap of what you covered:

### âœ… Project setup and structure

- Installed and configured a **TypeScript project** in iR Engine.
- Integrated the project with the engine using **`xrengine.config.ts`**.

### âœ… Entities and components

- Created an **entity** and assigned **core components**.
- Used **`NameComponent`**, **`TransformComponent`**, and **`PrimitiveGeometryComponent`**.

### âœ… Working with systems

- Defined a **system** to manage entity logic.
- Used a **custom component** to track state.
- Queried entities dynamically using `defineQuery()`.
- Controlled execution flow by **ensuring systems only run when needed**.

### âœ… Best practices

- Applied **ECS principles** to separate **data** and **logic**.
- Ensured **systems executed efficiently** by processing only relevant entities.
- Structured the code using **modular and scalable design patterns**.

With these skills, you can now confidently create **interactive scenes and dynamic systems** in iR Engine.

## Whatâ€™s next?

Now that youâ€™ve learned the essentials, itâ€™s time to expand your knowledge with the [Engine basics tutorial](./../03_basics_tutorial/index.md), where you will learn:

- **Writing clean and maintainable code**: Learn best practices for structuring your project efficiently.
- **Building custom components**: Extend the engineâ€™s functionality by defining your own component data.
- **Defining queries**: Retrieve and manipulate entities dynamically based on their components.
- **Working with physics**: Add rigidbodies, collisions, and physics interactions to your entities.
- **State management**: Optimize how entities store and update data within systems.
- **Managing environments and scenes**: Control scene publishing and world loading.
