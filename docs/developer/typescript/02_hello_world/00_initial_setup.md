# Initial setup

In this tutorial, you will use the <a href="https://github.com/ir-engine/ir-tutorial-hello" target="_blank">Hello World project</a> to learn how to work with iR Engine. This project provides a minimal working example to help you explore the engine‚Äôs core concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed the [**Quickstart guide**]() and have iR Engine installed.
