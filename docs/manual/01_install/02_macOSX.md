# Installing on macOS

## Introduction

This guide details the installation process for the iR Engine on macOS devices.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before starting the installation:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Installation instructions

Follow these steps to set up the iR Engine on your macOS device.

### Step 1: Prepare your project

First, generate a copy of the project by cloning the repository and navigate to the project directory:

::::workflow-block
:::workflow-block-item
Open your terminal
:::

:::workflow-block-item
Clone the repository by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ir-engine/ir-engine.git
```
:::

:::workflow-block-item
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository by running:

```bash
cd ir-engine
```
:::
::::

### Step 2: Set up environment variables

The iR Engine requires specific environment settings. Configure them by running:

```bash
cp .env.local.default .env.local
```

This command creates a copy of the default environment file, `.env.local.default`, renaming it to `.env.local` for use by the application.

### Step 3: Install and activate the recommended Node.js version

The iR Engine functions with a specific Node.js version, outlined in the `.nvmrc` file. To activate the recommended version, run:

```bash
nvm use
```

**Command output options**:

- **If the version is found (✅):** The system switches to the recommended Node.js version.
- **If the version is not found (❌):** The system returns a message indicating the missing version.

To resolve, run the following commands:

::::workflow-block
:::workflow-block-item
Install the missing version:

```bash
nvm install <version>
```
:::

:::workflow-block-item
Activate the version:

```bash
nvm use
```
:::
::::

### Step 4: Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Upon completion, proceed to initialize and run your development environment.

## Run your development environment

This section contains the instructions to run your local development environment.

### Step 1: Start Docker and initialize the database

::::workflow-block
:::workflow-block-item
Open Docker Desktop
:::

:::workflow-block-item
Initialize the database by running:

```bash
npm run dev-reinit
```
:::
::::

### Step 2: Start the development environment

Launch the iR Engine development environment with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

:::hint{type="success"}
This command opens the application at `https://localhost:3000/location/default` in your web browser.
:::

### Step 3: Open your development environment

Navigate to the application's URL in your browser to start working with the iR Engine development environment.
