# Installing on Windows with WSL2

This guide has been tested on Windows 10 (22H2) and Windows 11.

## Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Remember to run Powershell in Administrator mode either by right clicking and selecting `Run as administrator` or by typing PowerShell in `Run` dialog box of Windows and pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` key combination.

Install Ubuntu distribution of Linux with one of these options:
- `wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu`
- Follow the [WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- [How to install WSL in Windows 11](https://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/)
- [Manual installation steps for WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual)

Once WSL is installed, make sure to:
- [Set up your Linux username and password](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password)
- [Update and upgrade packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#update-and-upgrade-packages)
- Verify the Ubuntu distribution with the command: `lsb_release -a`
- You can verify your WSL/Ubuntu installation by executing this command in PowerShell: `wsl -l -v`

## Install Docker Desktop
Install docker desktop with the WSL 2 backend.
You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

Make sure to enable your WSL distribution once docker desktop is installed and running.
You can do so from Docker Desktop App by visiting `Settings > Resources > WSL Integration`.
Enable integration with Ubuntu, and make sure to hit `Apply & Restart`.

## Install Node
If Node is not already installed on your machine _(check with `node --version`)_, you can do so by first installing `nvm` and then installing Node with nvm.
> **Important**:
> Make sure that the commands in this section are run inside Ubuntu WSL.
> To ensure that this is the case, there are two options:
> 1. Launch WSL manually:
>     1. Run Powershell in Administrator mode and run Ubuntu using the command: `wsl`.
>     2. After logging in to Ubuntu, run the command: `cd ~/`
> 2. Open your application menu and search for `Ubuntu Terminal`

To install `nvm`, run the following commands in your WSL Ubuntu terminal:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
source ~/.profile

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"                   # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # This loads nvm bash_completion
```
Verify that `nvm` was installed correctly by using the command: `nvm --version`.
Afterwards, install Node 22 with:
```bash
nvm install 22
```
You can verify your Node version with the command: `node --version`.

<!-- Start of partial: PythonUbuntu -->
## Install Python 3
If Python 3 (`pip3 --version`) is not already installed on your device, you can do so by running following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
```
You can verify that Python3 is installed correctly with the command: `python3 --version`.

<!-- End of partial: PythonUbuntu -->

<!-- Start of partial: MakeUbuntu -->
## Install Make
If Make (`make --version`) is not already installed on your device, you can do so by running following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```
You can verify that Make is installed correctly with the command: `make --version`

<!-- End of partial: MakeUbuntu -->

## Clone iR Engine repo to your local machine
Clone iR Engine repo on your machine by running the following command from your WSL Ubuntu terminal:
<!-- Start of partial: CloneInstructions -->
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ir-engine/ir-engine --depth 1
```
> **Warning**:
> Adding `--depth=1` will significantly reduce the amount of data downloaded when cloning, but it will also create a `Shallow Copy` of the engine's repository.
If you need to download any branch other than `dev`, or go back in git history into an older commit, you will have to unshallow the repository first, or else any branches and older commits won't be accessible. The command to undo cloning with `--depth=N` is either `git fetch --unshallow` or `git pull --unshallow`

<!-- End of partial: CloneInstructions -->

Change directory to the location where `ir-engine` repository is cloned with:
```bash
pwd                 # Prints the current working directory
cd ir-engine   # Change directory to `ir-engine`
```
If an `.env.local` file does not exist in the root of your iR Engine repository folder, then create it by duplicating the `.env.local.default` file:
```bash
cp .env.local.default .env.local
```

Afterwards, install npm packages with:
```bash
npm install
```

> Note: If you find issues related to `mediasoup` when running `npm install`, then:
> - Remove the `mediasoup` package from `packages/instanceserver/package.json` file of iR Engine's source code.
> - Run `npm install` again.
> - Run: `npm install mediasoup@3 -w @ir-engine/packages/instanceserver`

## Initialize MariaDB server
You will need to initialize the engine's database with tables and data if you are running the engine for the first time. You can do so with:
```bash
npm run dev-reinit
```

## Start the engine
Run the iR Engine's stack with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
If everything went well, you will now be able to open iR Engine in your browser by navigating to [https://localhost:3000/location/default](https://localhost:3000/location/default).

## Accept certificates
<!-- Start of partial: AcceptCertificates -->
When accessing the iR Engine for the first time, browsers block access due to **self-signed certificates**. This prevents you from accessing the Admin panel and the Editor. To bypass this, manually accept the certificates:

:::::workflow-block
:::workflow-block-item
**Open developer tools**

- **Chrome/Edge:** Click the three-dot menu â†’ *More tools* â†’ *Developer tools*
- **Shortcut:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `F12`
- Navigate to the **Console** tab.
:::

:::workflow-block-item
**Identify certificate-related errors**

Check for network request errors related to:

- **WebSocket connections** (`wss://` URLs)
- **HTTPS requests to localhost**

The following addresses require certificate approval:

- `https://localhost:3030` â€“ API server
- `https://localhost:8642` â€“ File server
:::

::::workflow-block-item
**Bypass the security warning**

1. Open these URLs directly in your browser:
   1. <a href="https://localhost:3030" target="_blank">https\://localhost:3030</a>
   2. [https://localhost:8642](https://localhost:8642)
   3. https\://localhost:8642
2. A **"Your connection is not private"** warning appears.
3. Click **Advanced** â†’ **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)**.
4. Reload the engineâ€™s website.

:::hint{type="info"}
** Why bypassing security warnings?**
Browsers block connections to self-signed certificates by default to protect users from potentially unsafe sites.&#x20;

For local development, it's safe to bypass these warnings, but only if you trust the sourceâ€”like your own machine or your team's local environment.
:::
::::
:::::

:::hint{type="success"}
Once completed, the iR Engine will be fully accessible. ðŸš€
:::

> _Note: You will be able to create signed certificates to replace the default ones when you deploy your own iR Engine stack._
